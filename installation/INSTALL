Download

You can get cmdtypist by cloning the repo from github, create an empty directory
called cmdtypist and cd into it. Download cmdtypist into it by running
		
		git clone https://github.com/Noslac/cmd_typist

Installation
------------
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing cmdtypist and all 
it's files. Run

					./install.sh 

to install cmdtypist

RUNNING:
-------

If install.sh exited with a success message, then you have installed cmdtypist,
you can then run the command 

	cmdtypist argument1 argument2 argument3

from any directory. argument1, argument2,... are valid cmdtypist arguments, 
to know all valid arguments, run the cmdtypist help command or consult the help 
file which comes with the program.

The above instructions have been tested on ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ubuntu 16.04 LTS

If running cmdtypist produces a "Fatal error: some files are missing" error,
then you probably did not place all cmdtypist files in the same directory.

command
	
		cmdtypist reset raw

to reset settings to default. But if you want to permanently uninstall cmdtypist,

To uninstall cmdtypist, open a terminal and cd into directory containing the 
unintall script by running

		cd $HOME/cmdtypist/uninstall/
